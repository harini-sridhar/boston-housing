## Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices

## Project Overview . 
Built a model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.

In this project, machine learning concepts are applied on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home.  Data exploration is done to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, the data is split into testing and training subsets, and a suitable performance metric is determined. Performance graphs are analyzed for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. An optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data is picked. Finally, this optimal model is tested on a new sample and a comparison of the predicted selling price to the data statistics is done.

## Description
The Boston housing market is highly competitive, and you want to be the best real estate agent in the area. To compete with your peers, a few basic machine learning concepts are leveraged to assist with finding the best selling price a home. The Boston Housing dataset contains aggregated data on various features for houses in Greater Boston communities, including the median value of homes for each of those areas. The goal is to build an optimal model based on a statistical analysis with the tools available. This model will then be used to estimate the best selling price for homes.

## Software and Libraries
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

## Starting the Project

This project contains three files:

- `boston_housing.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `housing.csv`: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
